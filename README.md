# 📚 Student Management System (C++)

## 📌 Project Description

This is a simple **Student Management System** developed in **C++** using **Vectors and Templates**.
The program allows users to perform basic operations like adding, displaying, searching, and removing student records through a menu-driven interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ➕ Add Student
* 📋 Display All Students
* 🔍 Search Student by ID
* ❌ Remove Student by ID
* 🚪 Exit Program

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* C++ Programming Language
* STL (Standard Template Library)

  * `vector`

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* Class Template
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Dynamic Data Storage using Vector
* Looping and Conditional Statements

---

## 📂 Class Structure

### 🔹 Template Class: `student<T>`

#### Attributes:

* `id` → Student ID
* `name` → Student Name

#### Methods:

* Constructor → Initializes student details
* `display()` → Prints student information
